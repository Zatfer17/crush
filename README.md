# üê¢ crush
`crush` is a minimal note taking app in the terminal, inspired by [Notational Velocity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKShuvEOiqA). Notes are stored locally (`Documents/Crush`) in plain markdown.

The app has 4 widgets:
- a search bar, to search and quickly create notes;

Depending on the focused tutorial different shortcuts will be available.
